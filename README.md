# Travel Tracker


### Abstract:
Travel Tracker is an application that allows a user to sign into their profile and estimate travel costs for various destinations and then request that booking which is sent to their agent and notifies the user of the pending travel booking. 

This application connects to multiple api's in order to grab destination, user and traveler data. Once I have access to these arrays, I then use JS to see where each traveler has been, calculate their total expenditure on traveling for this year and to estimate the cost of their next trip.

### Context:
I completed this solo project over 7 days and after attending 12 weeks of schooling at Turing School of Software and Design.

### Learning Goals & Project Outcomes:
* I learned how to implement GET requests to access various api's and create POST requests to update traveler data on the appropriate server. Many iterator methods were essential for manipulating the data in order to calculate expenses, destinations, past trips and pending trips, as well as, the use of classes. 
* I followed test driven development with a small sample data set to make sure my classes and methods were sound before using them on the data from api's. 
* This application was built using JS, HTML, CSS and Webpack.
